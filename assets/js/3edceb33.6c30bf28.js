With Solana, there are game SDKs you can build for IOS, Android, Web and Native Windows or Mac. Using the Unity SDK you could even connect Nintendo Switch or XBox to Solana theoretically. Many game companies are pivoting to a mobile first approach because there are so many people with mobile phones in the world.
